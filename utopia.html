    <p>Remarks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are significant differences in income based on both industry and gender in world1.
        </li>
        <li>The distribution of genders across different industries is unequal in world1, indicating that certain industries have a higher representation of one gender over the other. This disparity suggests potential biases or systemic factors influencing gender representation in various fields in world1.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
  
        <h4><strong>ANOVA</strong> test to check if there is difference in income based on gender in world1.</h4>
        <p>Using a significance level of 0.05.</p>
        <p>Stating the Hypothesis:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Null hypothesis: There is no difference in income based on gender.</p></li>
        <li><p>Alternate hypothesis: There is difference in income based on gender.</p></li>

        <p>The obtained test results are -> F-statistic: 923.1415737034732, P-value: 5.355760965843564e-199</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Since the p-value is much less than the significance level of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is difference in income based on gender in world1.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><p>Null hypothesis: There is no difference in income based on ethnic category.</p></li>
        <li><p>Alternate hypothesis: There is difference in income based on ethnic category.</p></li>

        <p>The obtained test results are -> F-statistic: 1125.691934385774, P-value: 0.0</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Since the p-value is significantly less than the alpha value of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is difference in income based on ethnicity in world1.</p>
    
        <h4>Post hoc tests</h4>

        <p><strong>In summary:</strong> All comparisons show significant differences in mean income between the ethnic groups analyzed, indicating that ethnicity does have an impact on income in world1.</p>
    
        <h4><strong>Examined the differences in years of education by gender in world1.</strong></h4>
        <p><strong>Chi-squared test between gender and education in world1.</strong></p>
        <p>Using a significance level of 0.05.</p>
        <p>Stating the Hypothesis:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Null hypothesis: The variables gender and education are independent.</p></li>
        <li><p>Alternate hypothesis: The variables gender and education are not independent.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anusha-raju/Utopia/main/images/chisuare%20world1.png" alt="Chi-squared test">
    
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Since the p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is not enough evidence to conclude that gender has an effect on education levels in world1, meaning that any observed differences in education levels between genders in world1 could likely be due to random chance rather than a systematic relationship.</p>
    
    
    



    <h3>Interpretation on World1 <a name="interpretationonWorld1"></a></h3>
    <p>1. Since the income histogram is right skewed, it indicates that a small number of individuals earn significantly more than the rest, which may suggest inequality.</p>
    
    <p>2. The plots and ANOVA tests suggest that the annual income depends on gender, ethnicity, and industry in world1, indicating systemic inequities.</p>
    
    <p>3. The plot of average income by industry and gender also suggests potential biases influencing gender representation in various industries.</p>

    <p>The basic structure is:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Entail liberal democracy or a republican form of government, in which people have a say in the matters that affect their lives.</li>
        <li>Guard against the extremes of inequality so that concentrations of wealth cannot be used to exploit the less wealthy or to buy politicians.</li>
        <li>Ensure that everyone has access to the necessities of life such as food, shelter, healthcare, etc.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>In both the worlds:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The variables defining demographics are age, gender, marital status, and ethnicity.</li>
        <li>The variables defining socioeconomic status are education, income, and industry.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Based on the interpretations of world1, there is an inequality in income and there is a potential bias influencing gender representations in various industries, and a difference in income based on ethnicity and gender which suggests that <strong>world1 is not fair</strong> on both demographics and socioeconomic status and is not close to a utopia.</p>
    
    <p>The analysis of world2 indicates that income is skewed due to variations across industries, while gender and ethnicity do not appear to influence annual income.</p>
    
    <p>In my view, different income levels across industries can still align with a utopian model due to the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Value-Based Income: In a utopia, income could be based on the value and societal contribution of different industries.</li>
        <li>Equity Over Equality: A utopian model might emphasize equity rather than strict equality.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Hence, I fail to infer that world2 is unfair and can suggest that world2 is close to a utopia.</p>
